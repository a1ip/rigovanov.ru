My name is Philippe Rigovanov. I am a teacher of Informatics in [Novorossiysk Professional College](http://nptech.ru).

This is my personal blog powered by [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io) static site generator on [Node.jsâ„¢](https://nodejs.org), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) templates, [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). CSS was borrowed from [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)'s [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Currently it is not structured as multilingual but just a mess of Russian and Enlgish languages.
